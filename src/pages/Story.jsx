              We began with a question:
              <br />
              why should gold ask you to be <em>careful?</em>

              <span className="dropcap">B</span>ariq began in Cairo with a simple
              frustration. The pieces we loved were beautiful, but they came with
              rules — take them off before you wash your hands, before the gym,
              before the sea. We wanted jewelry that could stay on.
            </Reveal>

            <Reveal as="p" delay={140}>
              So we started with the material. High-grade 316L stainless steel,
              finished in warm gold PVD or brushed silver. It is strong, it does
              not tarnish like plated brass, and it is comfortable enough to forget
              you are wearing it. The finish is bonded to the steel rather than
              layered on top.
            </Reveal>

            <Reveal as="p" delay={190}>
              From there, the collection grew slowly: a fine chain at the
              collarbone, a hoop that catches the light, a signet ring, a bangle
              that stays on through everything. Quiet shapes, a comfortable weight,
              and a finish that works with what you already own.

            Stainless steel is forgiving in the best way. It does not mind water,
            it holds its shape, and it keeps a fine polish. Our gold PVD finish adds
            warmth without the delicacy of plating. Rinse with fresh water after
            swimming, dry with a soft cloth, and it will keep its colour.
